Sarcasm as a Service [DEV1149]



In 2014 the US Secret Service put a search for a software system for analyzing social media data out to tender. You see, natural-language processing (NLP) enables you to determine “sentiment” —where you identify and categorize opinions expressed in a piece of text. NLP struggles with sarcasm, however. Sarcasm is one of the most complex forms of human expression—and it’s therefore one of the hardest to teach AI systems. To detect sarcasm properly, a computer would have to figure out that you meant the opposite of what you just said. Is it possible to build a sarcasm detector? Join this session’s speaker on a hilarious journey deep into the underbelly of the internet and follow his attempt (and sometimes failure) to create his own sarcasm as a service. C’mon—it’s not that hard.
